# ✨ Node.js + Prisma Login & Post App

Hey! 👋 This is a simple fullstack app I made using **Node.js**, **Express**, **HTML**, and **Prisma** with **PostgreSQL**.

It has a **signup/login system**, and once logged in, users can **create posts**, and those posts are saved to their account.

I didn’t use JWT or bcrypt — everything is kept clean and beginner-friendly. The idea is just to **understand the flow** from frontend to backend to database.
